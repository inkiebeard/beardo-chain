# Beardo Chain

## Purpose

To provide a backbone for determining data capital goods and ensure data progenitor and lineage. THIS IS NOT A DECENTRALISED CRYPTO COIN. Firstly branching is encouraged, there are core functions to find the count 
and place within the lineage. Value is ascribed to a block based on the "distance" from the initial source block of the chain. For example a blog post would be the initial block attached to the source of the chain, then each comment on that post would be attached **at to that same block as their parent** then a thread of replies would branch off one of those comments; the initial blog post as the starting block of the initial chain
becomes greater in "value" the more ancestors it has.
